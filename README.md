# Barnacle Genetics - Demographic History

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the demographic history of the barnacle species *Balanus improvisus* using *MSMC2* and *SMC++*. These tools estimate the effective population size (*Ne*) over time, providing insights into the evolutionary history of the species.

## Author

## Parameters
- **Mutation rate:** 2.76e-08
- **Generation time:** 1 year

## Tools Used
- **MSMC2:** Multi-Species Coalescent method to infer population size history.
- **SMC++:** Sequentially, the Markovian Coalescent method is used to infer population size history.

## Project Structure
- **QC/**: Contains the scripts to check quality control of raw fastqs.
- **Scripts/**: R and shell scripts used for data processing and analysis in MSMC2 and SMC++.
- **Plots/**: Outputs of the plots from R.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Results
The analysis results include estimates of the effective population size (*Ne*) of *B. improvisus* over time. These results provide insights into the species' demographic history and evolutionary patterns and show evidence for rapid population expansion following the last glacial maximum (10-15 kya).
